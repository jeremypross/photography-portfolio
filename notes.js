HOME PAGE: IMAGE GRID?

LANDING PAGE?

JQUERY IMAGE GRID / LIGHTBOX plug-in
// make pages flex image grid that pop out into lightbox when you click into an image

NAV
// h1 and social media buttons are moving when you scale browser > 768 px

build out a function page 


AFTER CLASS: 

// code responsive so that the lightbox essentially turns off and image is grid of images 100% width.
